Scape - The Minecraft Progression Overhaul Mod

This mod is created by Kritya, GitHub username: krityan.

Art is going to be provided by Gigsey, early placeholder art may be created by Kritya to continue development.

This mod looks to overhaul the shallow progression system of MineCraft. Going from wood -> stone -> iron -> diamond, being at the 3rd stage within 10-20 minutes of play then searching for a few hours to finish progression. MineCraft has the potential to be a very deep progression game, as opposed to a building game with a shallow progression experience. That is what I aim to achieve with this mod, by overhauling the progression system and adding new progression systems to run alongside it, I aim to enrich the experience of playing through MineCraft beyond the first few hours of play.
