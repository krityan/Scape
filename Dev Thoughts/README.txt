This section is dedicated to quick notes and thoughts from the developers about what is currently being worked on.

This can range from monologues about implementing new ideas to the mod to potential art styles.

This should not be taken as a promise of future features, as an idea may be put to the side after it has been discussed here and be released later/not released at all. This is meant as an insight to the minds of the people working on the project, as opposed to spoilers of upcoming mod content.
